==========================================
An intro to Tekton pipelines and Knative
==========================================

Install xelatex with most of the plugins via your distro.
Either xelatex or lualatex are required for the fontspec package to work.

Install the IBMPlex font from https://github.com/IBM/plex.

To build the example just run::

  % xelatex tekton_knative.tex

the output will be tekton_knative.pdf.
